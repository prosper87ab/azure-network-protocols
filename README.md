# Custom App Integration with Okta (SAML 2.0)
**Python Flask · SAML 2.0 · Okta · Active Directory · Windows Server**

Hi,

In this hands-on project I demonstrate how to build and deploy custom SAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP) applications integrate them with Okta as the Identity Provider (IdP). This is hosted on a Windows Server domain controller running an on-premises Active Directory environment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to simulate what it looks like when an organization integrates internal or third-party applications with a cloud Identity Provider using SAML 2.0, without needing access to the real paid SaaS tools.

Three custom web applications were built to act as SAML Service Providers, each themed to represent a common enterprise application. Okta serves as the Identity Provider, and all users are sourced from an on-premises Active Directory domain (`yearwood.local`).

When a user visits one of the apps and clicks **Sign in with Okta SSO**, the full SAML authentication flow executes, the browser is redirected to Okta, the user authenticates, Okta sends a signed SAML assertion back to the app, the app validates it, and a session is created.

---

## Environment

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Domain | yearwood.local |
| Domain Controller | Windows Server 2025 (on-prem) |
| Identity Provider | Okta (trial org) |
| Directory | Active Directory synced to Okta via AD Agent |
| App Runtime | Python 3.11 / Flask |
| Protocol | SAML 2.0 |
| Transport | HTTP (homelab — no TLS) |

---

## How SAML Works

```
1. User visits app (Service Provider)
         ↓
2. App redirects browser to Okta (Identity Provider) with SAML Request
         ↓
3. User authenticates at Okta
         ↓
4. Okta sends signed SAML Assertion back to app's ACS URL via browser POST
         ↓
5. App validates the assertion using Okta's X.509 certificate
         ↓
6. Session created — user is logged in
```

**Key terms:**
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| SP (Service Provider) | Your app — the resource being protected |
| IdP (Identity Provider) | Okta — the system that verifies identity |
| ACS URL | The endpoint on your SP that receives the SAML assertion from Okta |
| Entity ID | A unique URI that identifies your SP to Okta |
| X.509 Certificate | Okta's public cert — used by the SP to verify the assertion was signed by Okta |
| SAML Assertion | The signed XML document Okta sends back confirming the user's identity |

---

## What Was Built

Three Python/Flask apps, each acting as an independent SAML SP:

| App | Simulates | Hostname | Port |
|-----|-----------|----------|------|
| Slack SP | Slack workspace | slack.yearwood.local | 5001 |
| GWorkspace SP | Google Workspace | gworkspace.yearwood.local | 5002 |
| SharePoint SP | Microsoft SharePoint | sharepoint.yearwood.local | 5003 |

Each app includes:
- A themed **login page** with an "Sign in with Okta SSO" button
- A **`/login`** route that initiates the SP-side SAML redirect to Okta
- A **`/saml/acs`** endpoint (ACS URL) that receives and validates Okta's SAML assertion
- A **`/saml/metadata`** endpoint that exposes the SP's metadata XML for Okta registration
- A **`/logout`** route that clears the local session
- A themed **dashboard** showing the authenticated user's identity pulled from the SAML assertion

---

## Phase 1 — DNS Setup

Before deploying the apps, three DNS A records were added in **Windows Server DNS Manager** under the `yearwood.local` forward lookup zone:

| Hostname | Type | Points To |
|----------|------|-----------|
| slack | A | 192.168.64.5 (DC IP) |
| gworkspace | A | 192.168.64.5 |
| sharepoint | A | 192.168.64.5 |

This allows any machine joined to `yearwood.local` to resolve `slack.yearwood.local` to the domain controller where the apps are running.

**Steps in DNS Manager:**
1. Server Manager → Tools → DNS
2. Expand Forward Lookup Zones → `yearwood.local`
3. Right-click → New Host (A record)
4. Add each hostname pointing to the DC's IP
5. Repeat for all three

---

## Phase 2 — Okta SAML App Configuration

Three SAML 2.0 applications were created in the Okta Admin Console — one per custom app.

**Steps for each app:**
1. Okta Admin Console → Applications → **Create App Integration**
2. Select **SAML 2.0** → Next
3. Fill in the general settings (app name) → Next
4. Configure SAML settings:

| Field | Slack Example |
|-------|--------------|
| Single Sign On URL (ACS) | `http://slack.yearwood.local:5001/saml/acs` |
| Audience URI (Entity ID) | `http://slack.yearwood.local:5001/saml/metadata` |
| Name ID Format | EmailAddress |

5. Finish → go to **Sign On tab** → click **View SAML Setup Instructions**

The setup instructions page provides the three values needed for `settings.json`:
- **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL** → goes into `idp.singleSignOnService.url`
- **Identity Provider Issuer** → goes into `idp.entityId`
- **X.509 Certificate** → goes into `idp.x509cert` (remove BEGIN/END header lines, paste as one continuous string)

> ⚠️ After creating each app, go to the **Assignments tab** and assign the relevant Okta groups — otherwise Okta will block the login even if SAML is configured correctly.

---

## Phase 3 — App Configuration (settings.json)

Each app has its own `saml/settings.json` file. The structure has two sections:

- **`sp`** — YOUR app's local addresses (yearwood.local URLs)
- **`idp`** — Okta's addresses and certificate (from Okta's setup instructions)

```json
{
  "strict": false,
  "debug": true,
  "sp": {
    "entityId": "http://slack.yearwood.local:5001/saml/metadata",
    "assertionConsumerService": {
      "url": "http://slack.yearwood.local:5001/saml/acs",
      "binding": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
    },
    "singleLogoutService": {
      "url": "http://slack.yearwood.local:5001/saml/sls",
      "binding": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
    },
    "NameIDFormat": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress",
    "x509cert": "",
    "privateKey": ""
  },
  "idp": {
    "entityId": "http://www.okta.com/<okta-app-id>",
    "singleSignOnService": {
      "url": "https://<your-okta-tenant>.okta.com/app/<app-path>/sso/saml",
      "binding": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
    },
    "singleLogoutService": {
      "url": "https://<your-okta-tenant>.okta.com/app/<app-path>/sso/saml",
      "binding": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
    },
    "x509cert": "<full-certificate-as-one-line-no-headers>"
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** The `sp.entityId` must be your **local** metadata URL — not Okta's issuer URL. The `idp.entityId` comes from Okta's "Identity Provider Issuer" field. Swapping these is the most frequent configuration error.

---

## Phase 4 — Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ installed with **"Add Python to PATH"** checked during install
- Visual C++ Build Tools (required by `python3-saml` on Windows)

### Install
```batch
INSTALL.bat
```
Installs all pip dependencies and creates the `saml/` config directories inside each app folder.

### Launch
```batch
START_ALL.bat
```
Opens three terminal windows, one per app:

```
slack.yearwood.local:5001       → Slack SP
gworkspace.yearwood.local:5002  → GWorkspace SP
sharepoint.yearwood.local:5003  → SharePoint SP
```

Each terminal will show:
```
* Serving Flask app 'app'
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:500X
* Running on http://192.168.64.5:500X
```
This means the app is live and listening. The red "development server" warning from Flask is expected and can be ignored for a homelab.

## Errors & Troubleshooting

Real errors encountered during deployment — documented because troubleshooting is the actual skill.

---

**Error 1: Python not found**
```
Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store
```
**Cause:** Python was not installed, or was installed without adding it to the system PATH.

**Fix:** Reinstall Python 3.11 from python.org. On the first screen of the installer, check **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking Install. Close and reopen all terminal windows after installing.

---

**Error 2: settings.json not found — path resolves with `..`**
```
Settings file not found: sharepoint-app\..\saml\settings.json
```
**Cause:** Python resolved `__file__` relative to the working directory rather than the script's actual location, causing it to look one folder up.

**Fix:** Updated `saml_utils.py`:
```python
# Before
settings_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "saml")

# After
settings_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "saml")
```

---

**Error 3: saml_utils.py loading from parent directory**
```
sharepoint-app\..\saml_utils.py
```
**Cause:** `sys.path.insert` in `app.py` was pointing one directory level up instead of the app's own folder.

**Fix:** Updated `app.py`:
```python
# Before
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))

# After
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **SAML 2.0 SP-initiated SSO flow** — full redirect, assertion, and session lifecycle
- **Service Provider vs Identity Provider** configuration — understanding which URLs belong where
- **Okta SAML app setup** — ACS URL, Entity ID, X.509 certificate, and metadata
- **DNS A record configuration** in Windows Server for custom subdomains
- **Active Directory + Okta integration** as the user source for SSO
- **Python path resolution on Windows** — a real deployment issue and its fix
- **AI-assisted development** — using Claude to generate boilerplate, then deploying, debugging, and owning the result
